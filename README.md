<h2>Shakespearean Text Generation using LSTM in PyTorch</h2>
<p>Built a character-level text generation model using PyTorch, that generates Shakespearean-like text. Employed an LSTM with 4 layers of 256 units each. The training process took nearly 5 hours on my system and the dataset used was of Shakespeare's writing, sourced from Andrej Karpathy's blog.<p>
