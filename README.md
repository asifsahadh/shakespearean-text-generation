<h2>Shakespearean Text Generation using LSTM in PyTorch</h2>
<p>I worked on building a character-level text generation model using PyTorch, that generates Shakespearean-like text. Employed an LSTM with 4 layers of 256 units each (1.8 million parameters) and the training process took nearly 5 hours on my system. The dataset used was of Shakespeare's writing, sourced from Andrej Karpathy's blog.<p>
